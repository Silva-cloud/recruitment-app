    title: 'Access to more candidates',
    body: `When you use online recruitment agencies, your job ads are
        available to anyone with an internet connection, anywhere in the
        world. As the last few years have taught us, creating and managing
        a successful distributed team is possible. It’s never been easier
        to work remotely. So the fact that someone lives in the Outer
        Hebrides needn’t mean their application is destined for the
        recycling bin. Working with online recruitment agencies, you can
        focus on talent rather than location and finding the very best
        people for your business from a large pool of candidates.`,

    title: 'Helps you target specific candidates',
    body: `Want the tech geniuses working for your competitor to come work
    for you? Using traditional recruitment agencies, this would be a
    tall order. But with online recruitment agencies, you’ll find it
    much easier to target specific candidates with your job ads and
    employer branding. For example, here at crooton we use geofencing
    technology. With this tech, we can target job ads at specific
    trade events, academic institutions, or prospective candidates
    working for competitor companies. This type of tailored approach
    means better job ad ROI and better quality candidates.`,

    title: 'Better communication with candidates',
    body: `Candidate experience is a big deal for any business. How a
    candidate is treated during the recruitment process impacts their
    interest in the role you’re advertising and their enthusiasm for
    any subsequent job offer you make them. Employer reviews also
    significantly impact talent acquisition, with 57% of job
    candidates avoiding companies with negative online reviews. One of
    the best ways to improve candidate experience? Consistent, timely
    and respectful communication. When you work with online
    recruitment agencies, you can keep in communication at every stage
    of the recruitment process. With the right tech, you can even
    automate messaging, view candidate status to tailor your
    messaging, and you can provide in-depth, helpful feedback to
    unsuccessful applicants.`,

  {
    title: 'Helps you to integrate your employer brand',
    body: `A strong employer brand helps attract applicants, makes your
    recruitment process more efficient, and helps you retain
    employees. Online recruitment agencies understand the importance
    of employer branding. And they provide lots of opportunities for
    you to sell that brand to prospective employees. Creating dynamic
    job ads with embedded employer brand videos or simply a link to
    your employer webpage is a branding opportunity you don’t get with
    traditional recruitment agencies. Online recruiters can also put
    your branded content and job ads in front of the right audiences,
    utilising various recruitment marketing channels to promote you as
    an employer.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'It saves time',
    body: `Online recruitment agencies use tech, automation, and online
    talent acquisition strategies to speed up recruitment. They have
    access to a large pool of candidates and know how to reach out to
    specific groups, while automation helps with candidate screening
    and communications. This all helps to create a streamlined
    process. Candidates progress quickly to interviews, which is
    excellent for candidate experience. And employers get to quickly
    and efficiently fill roles.`,
